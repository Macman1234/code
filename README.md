This is a collection of my projects in several programming environments. My interests lately are <a href="https://processing.org">Processing</a> (Java) and <a href="http://p5js.org">p5</a>  (Javascript) for visualizations and generating PDF cut files for our laser cutter, and Python for finance in my role as Quant Placement Director for the <a href="http://dept.math.lsa.umich.edu/quantfin/index.html">Quantitative Finance and Risk Management program</a> at the University of Michigan.

* <a href="https://github.com/pbenson/code/tree/master/p5">Processing 3</a>. Because Processing is Java, I  don't often host these anywhere for you to see. An example that uses John Ressig's processing.js on-the-fly translation of Java into Javascript is <a href="http://www.mrbenson.org/simulating-collisions-in-two-dimensions/">here</a>. However, p5 is a superior solution for hosting, and I now use Processing primarily for its pdf library, as I use pdfs on our laser cutter.
* <a href="https://github.com/pbenson/code/tree/master/p5">p5</a>. I host some of these on my <a href="http://www.mrbenson.org/p5/">teaching website</a>.
* <a href="https://github.com/pbenson/code/tree/master/python">Python</a>. I install <a href="https://www.continuum.io/downloads">Anaconda locally</a>, and do most of my writing with the included <a href="http://jupyter.org">Jupyter</a>. The resulting notebooks, identified by .ipynb extension, are automatically run by GitHub (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/pbenson/code/blob/master/python/Project%20Euler%20in%20Python.ipynb">Project Euler</a>), so all you need to do is check your notebook in and sync.
