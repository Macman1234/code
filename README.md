This is a collection of my projects across several programming environments. My interests lately are <a href="https://processing.org">Processing</a> and <a href="http://p5js.org">p5</a> for visualizations and generating PDF cut files for our lasercutter, and Python for finance in my role as Quant Placement Director for the <a href="http://dept.math.lsa.umich.edu/quantfin/index.html">Quantitative Finance and Risk Management program at the University of Michigan</a>.

* <a href="https://github.com/pbenson/code/tree/master/p5">Python</a> (I install <a href="https://www.continuum.io/downloads">Anaconda locally</a>, and do most of my writing with <a href="http://jupyter.org">Jupyter</a>)
