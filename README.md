This is a collection of my projects across several programming environments. My interests lately are Processing and p5 for visualizations and generating PDF cut files for our lasercutter, and Python for finance in my role as Quant Placement Director for the <a href="http://dept.math.lsa.umich.edu/quantfin/index.html">Quantitative Finance and Risk Management program at the University of Michigan</a>.
